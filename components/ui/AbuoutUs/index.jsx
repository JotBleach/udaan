                    <p>As an organization, we propel the next generation of trailblazers and fly high with our spirit for dance. Not only does our competition dedicate itself to transforming our cultural passions into tangible action, but we are a melting pot that welcomes and encourages teams from all backgrounds, cultures, and locations to participate. With a campus culture that promotes diversity and inclusion, Udaan is representative of just that. We are bold, which means our competition is an outlet for teams to express themselves while still experiencing a sense of south asian unity. Udaan lifts one another up, and we can’t wait to share this spirit with participants of our competition.</p>
